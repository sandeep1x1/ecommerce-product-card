# Final Report: Product Card UI Implementation

## Requirements Recap
- Build a responsive Product Card UI for a product listing page.
- Card must display: product image, name, price, variant options (label), and an Add to Cart button.
- If a product is unavailable, show 'Out of Stock' and disable the button.
- Use real or test data, modern UI/UX, and ensure responsiveness.
- Provide a working demo and a brief note on layout and responsiveness.

## Implementation Summary
1. **Planning & Analysis**
   - Reviewed requirements and project structure.
   - Chose React for implementation, using Redux for cart state.
   - Analyzed product data and determined how to mock availability for demo.

2. **Component Design & Implementation**
   - Created a reusable `ProductCard` component with props for product data.
   - Designed a clean, modern, and accessible card layout using a dedicated CSS file.
   - Ensured the Add to Cart button is always at the bottom of the card.
   - Added logic to show 'Out of Stock' and disable the button for unavailable products (two products marked as unavailable for demo).
   - Used react-hot-toast for in-page notifications when adding to cart.

3. **Integration & State Management**
   - Integrated ProductCard into the product listing (Products.jsx), mapping API data to the required props.
   - Ensured compatibility with Redux cart state and Cart page display.
   - Fixed cart logic so products added from ProductCard appear in the cart.
   - Added a "Remove" button in the cart to remove products entirely.

4. **Testing & Responsiveness**
   - Verified that all cards render correctly, including out-of-stock states.
   - Checked that Add to Cart works and updates the cart page.
   - Ensured the layout is responsive and accessible (keyboard navigation, alt text, color contrast).

## Layout & Responsiveness Note
- The Product Card uses a flexbox layout for vertical stacking and grid display.
- Responsive CSS ensures cards stack on mobile and display in a grid on larger screens.
- All interactive elements are accessible and visually clear.

## Demo & Delivery
- The implementation is ready for demo and review.
- All requirements from the test have been met, with extra attention to UX and code quality.
